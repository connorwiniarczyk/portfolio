## Portfolio Website

[www.connorwiniarczyk.com](http://www.connorwiniarczyk.com)

A website for showing off some of the cool stuff I've worked on. Powered by
[Serv](https://github.com/connorwiniarczyk/serv)

The site references a directory called media, which isn't version controlled 
and needs to be added manually by way of a symlink or docker volume
