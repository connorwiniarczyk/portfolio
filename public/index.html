		<h1># FSAE Battery Packs and BMS</h1>
		<p>Each year, members of Lafayette's Electrical and Mechanical Engineering departments work to build an electric car to compete in the FSAE formula hybrid competition. The vast majority of the car is designed and manufactured in house by students.</p>

		<p>As a part of this team, I helped to design and build a new set of battery packs for the car, which came complete with a custom Battery Management System, CAN interface, and numerous safety features. </p>

		<h1>#  CellMan</h1>
		<p>CellMan is an abbreviation of Cell Management Board, a printed circuit board I designed for the FSAE battery pack above as part of its Battery Management System. Functionally, the BMS consists of a network of these CellMan boards controlled over I2C by a central Pack Management (PacMan) Board.</p>
		<p>Each CellMan mounts to a prismatic LiFePO cell and measures its voltage and temperature to be reported back to PacMan. Each CellMan Board also contains a flyback converter for facilitating an active balancing circuit between the cells.</p>

		<h1>#  Flip Pixel</h1>
		<p> Flip Pixel is an attempt at creating an open source flip dot display for electronics hobbyists and other display enthusiasts. I started working on this with in 2018 with my friend Hayden Dodge, and it is still very much a work in progress. Initially, we conceived the idea for a school project when, after shopping online for a flip dot display we could play with, decided that they were way too expensive and that we could easily build our own for less money. We eventually found out that this wasn't true, but the project was interesting enough to keep us motivated even after the course ended. </p>
		<p> The display is built from a grid of small, 3D printed discs with small magnets embedded within them. They are free to rotate about one of their axes, and their orientation can be changed by passing current through a pair of solenoids that lie beneath each one.</p>

		<h1># SCADA</h1>

		<p>On the Lafayette FSAE car, each subsystem exposes a CAN interface that it uses to broadcast data about its state to the rest of the car. SCADA is the system responsible for collecting, calibrating, and logging this data so that it can be presented to the team in an easy to digest format. It runs on a Raspberry Pi inside of the car's "CarMan" enclosure, and uses CAN traffic to determine the state of the Car.</p>
		<p>The design of SCADA is influenced heavily by the Unix philosophy, in that it is composed of several smaller components, each of which is responsible for exactly one thing. In this case, the components are daemonized python scripts managed by systemd, which communicate with each other through a local Redis instance and form a highly configurable data pipeline.</p>
