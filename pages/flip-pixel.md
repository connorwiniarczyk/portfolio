# Flip Pixel Display

## The Goal:

To create a fully functional display using only electro-mechanical parts. Rather than changing the color of various light sources to create pixels, as a more traditional display might do, we wanted to achieve the same effect by flipping individual squares of plastic back and forth, with a different color painted on each side.

## The Result:

Sadly, we were only able to get a single pixel working to any degree of reliability. Introducing additional pixels would cause interference issues
