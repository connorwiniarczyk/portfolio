Its being driven by Half H bridges which we built on the prototyping board to the right, and controlled by an ESP-32 running micropython. The Half H bridges are each made up of 2 N channel MOSFETS, whose gates are driven by the combination of a smaller N channel MOSFET and pull up resistor, which allows the the ESP-32 to drive the gates of the high side MOSFETS with a 3.3V signal. We were hoping to eventually build several of these H Bridge modules and combine them to drive more and more pixels simultaneously."
